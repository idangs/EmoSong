Project Description
This is an application that automatically plays appropriate genre of music depending on the user’s facial expressions. 
The goal of this application is to lighten up the user’s mood, based on the user’s smile index.


A clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engage the areas you've identified. 
What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?

Kotlin and Android Studio were new to us, so we had trouble navigating through the platform. We were trying to use Sound Cloud 
for streaming but they are not currently offering their API's to any new applications at the moment.
